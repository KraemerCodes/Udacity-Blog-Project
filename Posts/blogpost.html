                            Ducks. The gateway drug into the homesteading world. It started with one duck, Ferdinand, who needed a friend. So we got him Delilah. But then he wasn’t a very good friend to Delilah and she needed friends.
                            Bailey and Daphne shortly joined the group and suddenly we had a mini flock. Here we are 7 years later and those first birds prompted us to move to a five acre farm and expand. Now with almost 30 ducks, three
                            geese, seven goats, two mini donkeys, and nine chickens we are an official homestead. Over the past few years we have learned how to use the food from our animals to feed and clean our family. From milk to eggs
                            to meat we have done it all. With the help of our kids we will hopefully grow and expand to using more of our animals to sustain ourselves and become healthier for it.
